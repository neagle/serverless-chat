# Serverless Chat

[View the deployed app.](https://serverless-chat-neagle.vercel.app/)

This is a proof-of-concept chat intended to show how to integrate a serverless app (this one uses NextJS on Vercel) with Ably, which provides websockets as a service.

All you should need to get it to work is to create an Ably account and app and set an `ABLY_API_KEY` value in your `.env` file, for local development. (And if you deploy to Vercel or anywhere else, you'll need to set the same value there.)

Then follow the instructions below for running the app.

---

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
